<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://devchallenges-portfolio-two.vercel.app/)

The challenge path's final boss !  
I first created a react app to display my projects. I'm feeling more and more confident with React's logic.  
I then had fun with grids and subgrids, and used seven breakpoints ! If I knew in advance I would use so many, I would have created responsive classes, which I didn't. That's how you gain experience isn't it ?

## Features

- [Steps to replicate a design with only HTML and CSS](https://devchallenges-blogs.web.app/how-to-replicate-design/)
Which I didn't follow enough, at least the first part, thinking about the responsiveness in advance. Lesson learnt !
