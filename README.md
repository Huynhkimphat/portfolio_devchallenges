<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

The challenge path's final boss !  
I first created a react app to display my projects. I'm feeling more and more confident with React's logic.  
I then had fun with grids and subgrids, and used seven breakpoints ! If I knew in advance I would use so many, I would have created responsive classes, which I didn't. That's how you gain experience isn't it ?

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/xobQBuf8zWWmiYMIAZe0) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Huynhkimphat/portfolio_devchallenges

# Install dependencies

- [Steps to replicate a design with only HTML and CSS](https://devchallenges-blogs.web.app/how-to-replicate-design/)
Which I didn't follow enough, at least the first part, thinking about the responsiveness in advance. Lesson learnt !
